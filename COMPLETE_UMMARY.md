## 💻 How to Use Your Trained Model

### Basic Usage

```python
import joblib
import numpy as np
import json

# 1. Load the model
model = joblib.load('models/tii_ssrc23_best_model_v1.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('processed_data/scaler.pkl')

# 2. Load attack mapping
with open('processed_data/attack_mapping.json', 'r') as f:
    attack_mapping = json.load(f)
label_to_attack = {v: k for k, v in attack_mapping.items()}

# 3. Prepare your data (84 features)
# Replace with your actual network features
sample = np.array([[
    1460,  # packet length
    6,     # protocol (TCP)
    80,    # destination port
    # ... 81 more features
]])

# 4. Scale the data
sample_scaled = scaler.transform(sample)

# 5. Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(sample_scaled)
confidence = model.predict_proba(sample_scaled)

# 6. Get attack name
attack_name = label_to_attack[prediction[0]]
attack_confidence = confidence[0][prediction[0]] * 100

print(f"Detected: {attack_name}")
print(f"Confidence: {attack_confidence:.2f}%")
```

### Batch Predictions

```python
# For multiple samples
samples = np.array([
    [/* sample 1: 84 features */],
    [/* sample 2: 84 features */],
    [/* sample 3: 84 features */]
])

samples_scaled = scaler.transform(samples)
predictions = model.predict(samples_scaled)

for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
    print(f"Sample {i+1}: {label_to_attack[pred]}")
```
